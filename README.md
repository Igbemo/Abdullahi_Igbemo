### About Me

I’m currently enrolled in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, learning both front-end and back-end development. My foundation in clinical healthcare and corporate health services, combined with an early career in education, drives my passion for technology that improves lives.

I believe in leveraging tech to shape the future of healthcare, education, and financial inclusion. I’m especially interested in creating tools that empower not just urban but rural communities across Africa.
